# faculty-engagement-inventory
In order to better understand existing relationships between KU Libraries and the KU campus, we will create an inventory or map of these relationships. This project will systematically document existing relationships to identify gaps and strengths. This repo will collect materials that we create in the process of documenting library engagement at KU. Please fork this repo for use at your library and let us know how you use and adapt this at your own institution.

### Why do an engagement inventory? :confused: ###

KU Libraries does not have a typical liaison model for librarian engagement. As a result, there are not specific assignments for those inside the library to most schools and departments at KU. The Libraries' Faculty Center is broadly charged with engaging with all faculty in all disciplines at KU and has an interest in ensuring that faculty have needed resources from the library for their research and teaching.

### How will the project work? :construction_worker: ###

The inventory project is a systematic process for documenting how and with whom librarians are working with faculty, students and other campus partners. After considering in-depth interviews with librarians, the team decided to conduct an initial survey of all library staff to get a very basic understanding of which library units are working with which KU units. Upon completion of the survey phase, we will conduct more in-depth discussions of existing relationships with a select group of librarians via focus groups or interviews. This second phase will help clarify questions that arise in survey responses and to gain a greater depth of understanding. After the two phases of data collection, the team will analyze the results and create a map that visualizes how the library is engaging with different campus units.

### What are our specific plans :globe_with_meridians: ? 

We've created a <a href="https://github.com/michaelpeper/faculty-engagement-inventory/blob/master/roadmap.md">roadmap</a> that lays out the work ahead and some key milestones to complete along the way.

### What do *we* need? ###

We need some help with the analysis phase and survey design.
